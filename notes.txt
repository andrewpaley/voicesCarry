# GOALS:
# 1) DONE: recognize individual quotes in text (needs training/testing)
# 2) DONE: collect more snippets (400+, roughly split 2/1 nonquotes/quotes)
# 3) DONE (v1): create alternate representations of quotes for learning and classifying -- (a) remove named entities and (b) create parse tree representation
# 4) DONE: freeze that v3/v4 model and then use it to do a pass pulling quotes and leading/trailing sentences from articles (grok v2)
# 5) DONE: create test suite and use results in project report
# --
# 6) FUTURE TODO (post project submit): try training categorizers to recognize a) subject and b) speaker
# 7) FUTURE TODO (post project submit): store those in a "context_snippets" table in jumbodb and then do a second pass of training to teach the system to recognize good context
# 8) FUTURE TODO (post project submit): use the weird quotes as sign of start and end -- removing them lost you some information!
